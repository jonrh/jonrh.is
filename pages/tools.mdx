<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
+ Currently still have the Rode Wireless Go II but no longer actively using it.
  A really great wireless microphone in a small package. Bought to improve
  audio quality in VoIP calls but not making nearly as many calls as before.
  The AirPods Pro 2 are good enough for occasional customer calls. Would
  recommend the Wireless Go II to office workers that make regular customer
  calls or audio/video team meetings. If making frequent calls a purpose
  built wired headset would probably be best.


<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
### 8th November 2022
[Apple Watch 4][watch] given away as a hand-me-down. Did not get a new watch.
Liked the sleep and health tracking of the device but not enough to warrant
buying a new watch. Enjoy having a free arm more.

[iPad Pro 11"][ipadpro] & [Apple Pencil 2nd gen][applepencil] given away as
hand-me-down. The iPad and pencil was great for signing PDFs and general
browsing. However the device did not live up to expectations doing frontend
development work. The hardware is great but the device is seriously hamstrung
by the operating system.

### 28th July 2022
Upgraded to a MacBook Air M2 from 15" MacBook Pro Late-2013.
