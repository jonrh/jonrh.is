<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
+ Currently still have the Rode Wireless Go II but no longer actively using it.
  A really great wireless microphone in a small package. Bought to improve
  audio quality in VoIP calls but not making nearly as many calls as before.
  The AirPods Pro 2 are good enough for occasional customer calls. Would
  recommend the Wireless Go II to office workers that make regular customer
  calls or audio/video team meetings. If making frequent calls a purpose
  built wired headset would probably be best.


<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
### 22nd May 2023
[Mac Mini Late-2018][macmini] given away as a hand-me-down. A great machine
that still has a lot left in it. Did not see much use after acquiring the 13"
MacBook Air M2. Have owned three Mac Minis in the past and they have all been
great, small, and cost effective machines. Some of Apple's finest work.

### 9th November 2022
Upgraded to AirPods Pro 2nd gen from 1st gen.

### 8th November 2022
[Apple Watch 4][watch] given away as a hand-me-down. Did not get a new watch.
Liked the sleep and health tracking of the device but not enough to warrant
buying a new watch. Enjoy having a free arm more.

[iPad Pro 11"][ipadpro] & [Apple Pencil 2nd gen][applepencil] given away as
hand-me-down. The iPad and pencil was great for signing PDFs and general
browsing. However the device did not live up to expectations doing frontend
development work. The hardware is great but the device is seriously hamstrung
by the operating system.

[AirPods Pro][airpodspro] given away as hand-me-down. Amazing headphones that
still had decent amount of life left. Although they had been used a lot (4-8h
per day) and battery capacity was reduced. Upgraded to the AirPods Pro 2nd gen.
Was initially very sceptical about the AirPods Pro but decided to give it a try
on a recommendation of others. Used Bose QC-35 before which had slightly better
sound and active noise cancelling. However the QC-35 would often have
connection issues especially when switching between multiple devices. The
AirPods switched more or less seamlessly between devices, sounded good enough,
and had good enough active noise cancellation. The winning formula was how
small the overall package is.

### 28th July 2022
Upgraded to a 13.6" MacBook Air M2 from 15" MacBook Pro Late-2013.
