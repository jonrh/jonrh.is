## The original vocals

> “At the present moment I’m not recording, I’m not on tour, I’ve never had a song who’s number 1
on Beatport. I’ve never been featured on JunoDownload or Trackitdown. I’ve never released vinyl but
what I do know is that I’ve been listening to elictronica for many years and I’ve every right to
speak my mind against the fabricated music that is being released on a daily basis. It’s absolutely
appalling! All these people think that if you’re on the Beatport top 10 then you’re making
something out of yourself, well your making a mockery out of electronic music! I’m a producer and I
come from the underground, and I’m quite frankly I’m sick and tired! And I’m here to go on these
rants on messageboards because I know I’ll never mount to anything and I need to make myself feel
better so when I’m not high on cocaine I’ll sit in front of this computer till the cows come home
and continue ranting and raving about artists that actually living out their dreams because I never
will!”

## Updates
1. This post previously only contained the original vocals but now there is a new version out
featuring Rob Swire from Pendulum. I disagree with the lyrics I found on another site so I decided
to make my own. It’s a little bit fuzzy so feel free to share your interpretation.
2. @DAN: Cheers, fixed it.
3. Adapted mostly to T-Bags version of the lyrics. After countless rounds of listening I gave up
and asked couple of my friends about the lyrics and most of them agreed on T-Bags version. However
most agreed that it was “we’re gonna…” instead of “we, you gonna…” in the chorus.
4. 31 Jan 2011: changed “I only had a chase, …” to “I only had a taste, …”. Thanx for the input
InternetGuy, ThunderPwny, ntrval & pablo!
