<Post title="How I use Beatport on a Mac" date="August 16, 2008">

I’ve put together a little screencast on how to fuse [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/) and
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) together. The outcome is a Beatport.app application that’s much nicer
to handle. You’ll need OSX Leopard for this to work.

<!-- Todo: add links -->
The screencast: Beatport on Fluid
The Beatport arrow: http://jonsi.net/media/screencast/beatport-arrow.png

**Note**: When picking an icon one could simply use the websites favicon. But that 32×32 pixel
image doesn’t look as nice in your alt tab nor in the dock -_-
