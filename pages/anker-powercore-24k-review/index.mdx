  use. Great companion for the MacBook Air M2. Full power, no more outlet
  worry."
>
  Have used the [Anker PowerCore 24K][apc24k] external battery for about 1
  year. 40 recharge cycles and 2439Wh of power output. It has proved to be a
  must have companion for the MacBook Air M2.

  The biggest benefit is I never need to worry where to sit anymore when
  working outside of the home. No more concerns about outlet proximity and
  awkward cord threading. Enables me to work outdoors on the roof where there
  are no outlets. Full brightness, full power, no concerns. The MBA charger is
  permanently left at home.

  The MBA lasts a long time on its own battery. But having an external power
  bank like the Anker offers great flexibility and security. The power bank
  will likely extend the lifetime of the MBA by taking on the recharge wear and
  tear. Great for when the machine will eventually be sold or handed down.

  Another benefit of the Anker PowerCore 24K is when traveling. Provides ample
  power on a long flight. Also great if outlets are in an inconvenient place at
  an accommodation. The power bank allows you to pick the exact spot where you
  want to charge devices.

  Minor cons:

  + Can not be charged with the [Compact 35W Dual USB-C][c35wdu]. Warns that
  the voltage is too high. Not been a problem as it is nearly always 90W fast
  charged via the Dell 42.5" UltraSharp monitor.
  + If it reaches 0% charge the Dell monitor does not seem to be able to start
  charging. A workaround has been to charge with other chargers to 1% then
  switch to 90W fast charging on the Dell. Not sure why it happens, perhaps the
  battery requires a bit of charge to be able to negotiate a fast charge.
  Happens very rarely. Start charging from 40% - 50% most of the time.
  + It is a heavy brick, 630g. Volume is similar to a 330ml (12oz) tall can.
  Measures 155.7 × 54.6 × 49.5 mm.
