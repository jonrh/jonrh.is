  title="Fix for deleted (missing) photos & videos after 5.1 to 5.1.1 iOS upgrade"
  date="June 24, 2012"
>

After I updated my iPhone's iOS operating system from version 5.1 to 5.1.1 I soon discovered that
all my photos and videos were gone (no longer visible in the Photos app). After a bit of
troubleshooting I figured out that all my photos & videos were in fact still on the phone but the
media library index had become corrupt or something alike. By deleting two files on the phone (by
using [iExplorer][0]), rebooting, opening the Photos app, and waiting a few minutes the media
library reindexed itself and everything was back to normal.

I followed [these instructions][1] but the files `.MISC/Info.plist` and `PhotosAux.sqlite` weren't
on my phone so I just deleted `DCIM_APPLE.plist` and `Photos.sqlite` which turned out to be enough.
