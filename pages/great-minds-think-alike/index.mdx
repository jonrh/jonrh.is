  same business idea as someone in the UK."

In the spring semester of 2008 me and 6 other students took a course on creating business models.
We designed from the ground up an idea of a small non/low-profit company that would enable people
to deliver important documents or messages to loved ones to help them sort things out after their
death. The main components of this idea would be a website where people could confidentially manage
things. The system would then be connected to a governmental system to get notified about deceased
individuals to know when to deliver the information.

Today I bumped into a [Slashdot article](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/08/16/0710254/How-To-Send-Email-When-Youre-Dead?from=rss)
about a website providing about the same [service](http://www.lastmessagesclub.co.uk/) in the UK.
The funny thing is we didnâ€™t know about it when we designed ours. Great minds think alike I guess.
