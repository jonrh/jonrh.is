  metaDescription="How to set up a staging subdomain like preview.example.com
  for Next.js & Vercel with latest changes."

  A recipe for a staging or preview environment on a static subdomain with the
  latest changes when using Next.js v14, Vercel, and GitHub Actions. Examples:

  + preview.example.com
  + staging.example.com

  When deploying Next.js projects on Vercel, the preview deployment URLs
  are unique and constantly changing. What motivated this work was integrating
  with a third party billing provider that needed a stable staging URL.

  Recipe overview:

  1. Permanently reserve the git branch name `preview`.
  2. Automatically update `preview` to latest with a GitHub Action.
  3. Assign preview.example.com to the `preview` branch.
  4. Add noindex HTTP header to `preview` deployments.
  5. Return correct `robots.txt` for production and previews.

  With this in place the website will not suffer duplicate content penalty
  from the preview subdomain which could otherwise negatively effect SEO
  rankings. Everything is in addition to the regular preview deployments and
  URLs. Next.js v14 is assumed.

  ## Subdomain / branch
  In Vercel it is possible to specify that all deployments on a certain git
  branch will be hosted on a given subdomain. Follow these steps to add a
  subdomain for a given branch:

  1. Vercel -> Project -> Settings -> Domain
  2. Add the subdomain: preview.example.com
  3. Press *Edit* on the new subdomain
  4. Change *Git Branch* to `preview`
  5. Hit Save

  Something to be aware of is that when adding a subdomain for a branch is
  that Next.js / Vercel will no longer automatically add the
  `x-robots-tag: noindex` HTTP header like it does by default for all
  preview deployments (all branches except `main`). This will be addressed
  below in the `next.config.json`.

  ## Vercel System Environment Variables
  For any of this to work the Next.js project will need to be aware of the
  the branch name that is being deployed. When deploying the project with
  Vercel, the "*Automatically expose System Environment Variables*" checkbox
  needs to be ticked. It can be found under Project -> Settings ->
  Environment Variables. The environment variable we are interested in is
  `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF` which is the git branch name that is being deployed.
  When the branch name is `main` production is assumed, and then a staging
  environment is assumed when the branch name is `preview`.

  ## noindex HTTP header
  Adds a `x-robots-tag: noindex` HTTP header to all endpoints when a deployment
  is on the `preview` branch. By default Vercel adds the same header to all
  regular preview deployments but at the time of writing when a subdomain is
  specified for a branch it no longer applies. This setting code manually
  performs the same task.

  ```javascript
  const isPreviewBranch = process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF === "preview";
  const defaultHeaders = [];
  const headersOnPreview = [
    {
      source: "/:slug*",
      headers: [
        {
          key: "x-robots-tag",
          value: "noindex",
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
  const nextConfig = {
    async headers() {
      return isPreviewBranch ? headersOnPreview : defaultHeaders;
    },
  };

  module.exports = nextConfig;
  ```

  ## robots.txt
  ```javascript
  // If the branch name is "main"
  const isProduction = process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF === "main";

  const production = {
    rules: {
      userAgent: "*",
      allow: "/",
    }
  };

  const preview = {
    rules: {
      userAgent: "*",
      disallow: "/",
    }
  };

  export default function robots() {
    return isProduction ? production : preview;
  }
  ```

  This generates the following `robots.txt` in production which permits
  all search engines indexing on all routes:

  ```
  User-Agent: *
  Allow: /
  ```

  Conversely on all other preview deployments the contents of `robots.txt`
  will be to respectfully request all bots (search engines) to not index any
  routes on the website:

  ```
  User-Agent: *
  Disallow: /
  ```

## GitHub Action

  Below is the GitHub Action that automatically updates the `preview` branch
  to the latest commit that was pushed on any other branch.

  The `.github/workflows/preview.yml` file:

  ```yml
  name: Preview
  on:
    push:
      branches-ignore:
        - preview # avoids endless recursion

  jobs:
    preview:
      name: Update preview branch
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Overwrite preview branch
          run: |
            # Fetch & checkout preview branch,
            # reset to pushed commit and force
            # overwrite the preview branch
            git fetch origin preview
            git checkout preview
            git reset --hard ${{ github.sha }}
            git push -f origin preview
  ```

  In the current configuration the `preview` branch is also updated with
  changes pushed to production (`main` branch). If that is not desirable
  just add "`- main`" to the `branches-ignore` list.
