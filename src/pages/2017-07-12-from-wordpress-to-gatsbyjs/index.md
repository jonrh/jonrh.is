Outline:

* Briefly mention the history my usage of Wordpress. When did I start using it, used it initially
on Bluehost but grew unhappy with it. Bought the ThemeCo X theme. Was pretty good but I could never
really customize it the way I really wanted.

* Experience with GatsbyJS. Pretty excited for the potential. However very sparse documentation.
* Mention issue with Google Analytics plugin.

* Briefly mention I'm hosting my site on AWS S3 + CloudFront.
