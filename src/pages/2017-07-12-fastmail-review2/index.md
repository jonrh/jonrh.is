Outline:

    * Used Bluehost before. Wanted to move away from it. Spam filtering was of limited use.
    Bluehost always pushing on me a SpamAssassin subscription (or something like that) for
    individual email addresses (In Fastmail it's included for all your emails).

    * Needed a trustworthy and permanent solution. For the next 10 years and ideally longer than
    that.

    * Don't trust Google, but certainly a very good option for people that do trust it.

    * Considered rolling my own. But then I found this blogpost from someone that did exactly
    that and gave up after a few years. Problem is you have to do IT, update software, take care
    of backups etc.

    * Mention that I brought along with me >10 years worth of emails. Was looking for an email
    solution for the next +10 years.


Tasks:

    * Figure out how many emails total I have. Using ~1600MB of sto
