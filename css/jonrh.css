/* Apparently GatsbyJS doesn't like global CSS files. This file is one such but apparently a
 * hack. GatsbyJS docs encourage the usage of Typography.js (a lib made by Kyle Mathews). I'm
 * not too thrilled about it. I use it here and there as leftovers from the starter blog.
 * However this is where I generally define my own custom CSS. See more here:
 *
 *     https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/
 *     https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/issues/51
 *
 * Long term I think it might make sense to go for CSS Modules, Glamor, Styled Components, etc.
